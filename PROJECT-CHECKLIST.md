## Key Differences: Personal vs Organizational Microsoft Accounts

| Feature | Personal Account | Organizational Account |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| App Registration | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Delegated Permissions | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| Application Permissions | ❌ Not Supported | ✅ Supported |
| Tenant | `consumers` | Custom tenant ID |
